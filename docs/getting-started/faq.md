# ❓ FAQ

### Is SwapKit Open Source?

Yes it is! We have proudly open sourced the SwapKit SDK as our commitment to the THORChain ecosystem and open-source ethos. You can view the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/thorswap/SwapKit).\

Alongside the SDK, our smart contracts are also open source, but our API is not. This is our competitive advantage, and we're handling it and aligning our strategy with the other big DEX aggregators like 1inch and Paraswap, who also keep their API closed source.

### What is THOR?

THOR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is used for governance of THORSwap proposals that determine how the THORSwap project will proceed on certain issues.

THOR can be staked on our interface for vTHOR, a tokenized vault token that adheres to the [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626). THOR stakers share 75% of the protocol revenue generated by THORSwap.
